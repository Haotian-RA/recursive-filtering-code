## Recursive-Filtering
This is a C++ header-only library for applying a recursive filter by filtering matrix of samples and cascading second order sections to realize both computational efficiency and filter's accuracy.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation
Clone the repository 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Haotian-RA/recursive-filtering-code.git
   cd recursive-filtering-code
   ```
Make and go into a sub-directory
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
Configure and build the header-only library by cmake
   ```js
   cmake ../
   sudo cmake --build . --config Release --target install
   ```
Test is also provided
   ```js
   make test
   ``` 
   
<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage
* Solve for the round error issue happening at building higher order recursive filter in direct form.

the cascaded form of recursive filter re-match up with the desired poles making the system stable.

* Filter matrix of samples rather than vector or scalar realizing more efficient computations.

filtering matrix of samples saves almost double time than vector of samples, 4 times than scalar.
